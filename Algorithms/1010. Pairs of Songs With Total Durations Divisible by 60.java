//https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/

//In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

//Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.
// Formally, we want the number of indices i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

//Example 1:

//Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
//(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
//(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
//(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60


//Example 2:

//Input: [60,60,60]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
